TODO

- get a spectrum of scales for both median and timeseries datasets
- fit models across entire spectrum and see how consistent the result is (deals with spatial autocorrelation) (looks a bit like the VIP apper hill order plots but with lines for all the predictors and pixel size on the x axis)
- calculate a rasteer highlighting highly consistent patches of celss across scales to zero in on where true signals are (e..g more than 90% of scales show this cell as being x)
